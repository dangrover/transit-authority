    <p>As promised, here's the first prototype release of Transit Authority.</p>
    
    <p>For those unacquainted, Transit Authority is a casual simulation game where the object is to build and run metro systems in cities around the world.</p>
    
<p>    With your feedback, once the mechanics and basic workings are solidified, I'll be finding a designer/art director to get the level of visual polish to what it needs to be.</p>

    <p>I'd love to hear your thoughts! Did you understand the game? What confused you? Is it a weird concept for a game? What would make it more fun? Should it be more realistic? Less? What cities would you like to see featured in it? What direction would you take it in?
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
    Thanks!

    <h3>MAJOR KNOWN ISSUES</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Handicap ramp upgrade does nothing.</li>
    <li>There is no limit to the amount of debt your agency can take on.</li>
    <li>Can scroll outside the map. Crash when placing things outside the map.</li>
    <li>Tracks are straight lines. In the real game, they'll be curvy!</li>
    <li>No saving or restoring games for now.</li>
    <li>No way to change the number of trains running at night</li>
    <li>Weird pixel cracks when you zoom and scroll</li>
</ul>
    
    <h3>MAJOR OPEN QUESTIONS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the sense of progression? How does the player grow between cities? What do we unlock/discover?</li>
    <li>Should there be disasters/strikes/delays? What does the player do to prevent them? How do they respond to them?</li>
<li>Should finance be a lesser aspect of the game? Are subsidies superflous? Should operational costs be surfaced and explored better?</li>
 <li>What sort of stats and analytics should be available, and how should they be presented?</li>
 </ul>
