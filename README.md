# Transit Authority
## A simulation game about public transit using real data.

Transit Authority is an original new city simulation game focused on planning, building, and running public transit. The scenarios in Transit Authority are based on real cities, initially generated from census and GIS map data. You'll recognize familiar landmarks and neighborhoods.

This project was funded by the Knight Foundation as part of the Prototype Fund.
